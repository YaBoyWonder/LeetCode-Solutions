# 2 Sum


Personally, I was stuck. My only thinking was, "Take the biggest value and subtract by it, and then take the next one, and so on". Yea, that wont work for nearly all of them. So, I watched a quick YT video at the start, about them talking about Brute Force apporach. And then, I realized I could make a O(N^4) algorithm by taking two for loops, and check the addition of the next value with the first comparing value to all of them.


## After

Looking at the solutions, I realized that I need to learn hashmaps. Hashmaps seem to be the faster/better solution to my problems, by lowering the complexity needed for the algorithm. But, at the end of the day, my solution is still viable and did work for the job.
