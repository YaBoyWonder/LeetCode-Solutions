# Roman to Integer


Take the Roman integer values into a map. Compare the second value to the first, based on those conditions, obtain map value and go on.


## After

Update the map style...  Do a for loop, but update it by going backwards in a way. Compare and see if the second value is bigger than the first. If bigger, add a neg. value of first.
If second is smaller, update the value with value of first.

Very creative thinking. I know how to do this method, it's just I wouldn't have thought about it like that.
